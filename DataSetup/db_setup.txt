All the files related to the project that will be deployed will be in the feedback folder
To create your own local environments in the vm please create another folder in the same directory as feedback

Login to db using commands
    ssh feedback@142.1.114.69 (cisco vpn on)
    pass: letmein888

Need to first create a new postgres user 
    sudo -i -u postgres
    psql
    CREATE ROLE feedback WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'letmein888';
    ALTER ROLE feedback CREATEDB;
    CREATE DATABASE feedback;
    \q
    exit

Now we can create the table (install postgressql if needed)
    make sure to have the datasets.sql file in the same folder
    psql
    \c feedback
    \i datasets.sql
    \d datasets (you should see the table along its columns)

To insert the data into the table make sure you have a csv formatted copy 
of the table. All you need to do is have a copy of the insert_to_datasets.py as well
    Make sure the path_to_csv is correct
    python -m venv env
    windows: env/Scripts/activate Linux: source env/bin/activate
    pip install pandas and psycopg2
    python insert_to_datasets.py
