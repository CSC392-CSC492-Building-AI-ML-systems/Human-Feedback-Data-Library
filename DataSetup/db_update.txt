# Database Update Instructions

These instructions will guide you through the process of updating the `datasets` table with new changes: adding a new column (`Name`)

Connect to the PostgreSQL Database. 
Open a terminal and connect to your PostgreSQL database using the following command: (use your username and database name)
```
psql -U feedback -d feedback
```

Once connected, confirm you're using the correct database:
```
\c feedback
```

To add the new `Name` column to the `datasets` table, run the following command:
ALTER TABLE Datasets
ADD COLUMN name TEXT;

Delete All Rows (Preserves Table Structure)
```
DELETE FROM datasets;
```

Run the Python Script to Insert Data
Exit the `psql` terminal and run the Python script to re-insert the updated data:
```bash
python insert_to_datasets.py
```

Verify New Data Insertions
After running the script, verify that the new data has been inserted correctly:

```bash
psql -U feedback -d feedback
SELECT id, name, link FROM datasets LIMIT 5;
```

You should see the updated entries with the `Name` column populated.
